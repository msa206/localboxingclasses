# Kids Boxing Classes: Everything Parents Need to Know

Boxing is a great sport for kids. It helps them stay active and learn new skills. Many parents wonder if boxing is right for their child. This guide will help you learn about boxing classes for kids.

## How Much Are Boxing Classes for Kids?

Most kids boxing classes cost between $50 and $150 per month. The price depends on a few things:

- How many classes per week your child goes to
- Where the gym is located
- What equipment is included
- If the gym offers special deals

Some gyms offer family discounts. Others have cheaper rates if you pay for several months at once. Many places also offer free trial classes. This lets your child try boxing before you pay for a full month.

Drop-in classes usually cost $15 to $25 per session. Monthly plans are often a better deal if your child wants to box regularly.

## What Age Can Kids Start Boxing?

Most boxing gyms accept kids starting at age 6 or 7. Some places take children as young as 4 for basic movement classes. The best age depends on your child.

Here's what to look for:
- Your child can follow simple instructions
- They can focus for 30 to 45 minutes
- They like being active and moving around
- They want to try new things

Kids under 10 usually don't do contact boxing. Instead, they learn basic moves and hit pads or bags. This keeps them safe while they learn.

Many gyms have different age groups:
- Ages 4-6: Basic movement and fun games
- Ages 7-10: Learning boxing basics with no contact
- Ages 11 and up: More advanced training
